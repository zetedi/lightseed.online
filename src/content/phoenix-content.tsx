        The first lifetree died. Its name is Mahameru, the three dimensional
        representation of the Sri Yantra. The name carried the intention: to
        connect to the deepest layer of creation and create a new society from
        there, from the bindu, from the center of the center, from the spiritual
        heart of the Universe and each and every one of us. His parent is from
        Place Jourdain in Brussels and it was planted from a branch. It survived
        the winter and new lovely leaves sprouted. However the insects loved it
        too much and I overcared. I've buried it in the same pot where Iâ€™ve
        planted a new branch of a willow tree from Waterloo. This is where the
        name Phoenix is coming from: arising from the death of creation a new
        Cosmic heartbeat, a new Pulse. By the way Waterloo is the place of the
        war which ended feudalism and brought peace for a long time.
