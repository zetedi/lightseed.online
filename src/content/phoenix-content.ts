    text: `The first lifetree died. Its name is Mahameru, the three dimensional representation of the Sri Yantra. The name carried the intention: to connect to the deepest layer of creation and create a new society from there, from the bindu, from the center of the center, from the spiritual heart of the Universe and each and every one of us. His parent is from Place Jourdain in Brussels and it was planted from a branch. It survived the winter and new lovely leaves sprouted. However the insects loved it too much and I overcared. I've buried it in the same pot where Iâ€™ve planted a new branch of a willow tree from Waterloo. This is where the name Phoenix is coming from: arising from the death of creation a new Cosmic heartbeat, a new Pulse. By the way Waterloo is the place of the war which ended feudalism and brought peace for a long time.`
