                &nbsp;&nbsp;The Secret Sun is the third part of the path of
                lightseed. After planting our intention in our heart, we plant a
                tree. Then the third part is to plant a seed in the community to
                foster a deeper connection with trees. For that a natural
                choice for example is to build a platform, a fountain, a bench,
                a guild, a bird feeder, a beehive or a piece of art close to the
                tree together with the members of the community.

              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                For the tree named Phoenix, the platform was the best choice.
                Since it is very close to the mediation path around the chateau
                of Hridaya France we cut a new path through the brumble towards
                the direction which seemed a better place for a platform. And it
                happened that the area and the platform itself is interwoven
                with magic.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                The first auspicious sign for building was the finding of the
                Bodhisattva stone, a big stone on the path. The hill does not
                have many stones and the Kogi people believe that finding a
                stone while cutting a path is a very good sign. After a couple
                of days of listening and cutting the way we ended up on the
                exact place where the permaculture design marked a place for a
                platform years before.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                The second auspicious sign was the holly tree, which in folklore
                is a sacred tree protecting the area from evil spirits and
                should not be cut, thus marking one side of the platform. The
                other side there was a group of small oak trees. These two trees
                are in constant battle according to folklore, emphasizing the
                polarity aspect.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                The other ones were the two stumps of the douglas firs which
                were cut about three years before. They were exactly across the
                middle so we could use them as a base and as a symbolic rebirth
                of the trees in a different form.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                The third one is the wild rose island which became apparent
                after the second cutting of the path and before starting of the
                building of the platform.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                When we marked the corners of the platform we hit another stone,
                the Heart Stone. The stone itself is so big and strong that it
                redirected the roots of the biggest tree around (the one in the
                back).
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                The building took place through the summer solstice, the
                international yoga day and the full moon the next day, St John’s
                day (with a fire ceremony), St Peter’s day, Madeira Day (madeira
                means wood in Portuguese) and Keti Koti, the celebration of
                freedom from slavery in Netherlands.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-center w-full text-justify">
                The number 37 is present in every aspect of the platform,
                sometimes deeply hidden. The marking in the concrete in the
                North-East corner is the number 37. There are 3x7 planks on the
                top. The platform wes consecrated on the second day of the
                seventh month, however the last layer of oil on top was soaking
                in the night of 3/7 and was sealed on that day with Shambo, a
                powerful shamanic drum. The reason why 37 was central to the
                symbolism is to emphasize the principles conducive to bodhi:

                The other symbolic number present was the number 108. The
                reinforcing beams are 108 cm long each, pointing at the cosmic
                number prevalent in yoga, and the reason being that on average
                the Sun is 108 Suns away, the Moon is 108 Moons away and the Sun
                is 108 Earths wide. -

                The Yin-Yang symbol and the polarities are represented by how
                the middle beam is on different sides of the middle supporting
                beams. The handmade marks in the opposing corners also
                represents polarity - the one opposed to one marked with the
                heart does not have a mark, it’s emptiness, nothing - it’s
                either love or nothing. The other two opposing corners are the
                37 representing the bodhisattvas and selflessness and the R, the
                mark of the individual, anonymous people who build the pyramids,
                the R put down by a desire to leave a trace and to mark. The two
                tree stumps below the platform are also symbolizing polarities
                with their roots hugging each other underground. -

                The bigger path towards the building one one hand took through
                Assisi, and from there are four stones embedded in the concrete
                on each corner of the platform. The water contains water from
                the temple where St. Francis’s final resting place is. The tap
                was just above his chamber.

                And from an even more overarching perspective the unmarked corner has a
                flower of life pendant embedded from the temple of Osiris in
                Abydos, Egypt, where the flower of life symbol appeared the
                first time.
