              &nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of <b>lightseed</b> is to bring joy. The
              joy of realizing the bliss of conscious, compassionate, grateful
              existence by opening a portal to the center of life. By creating a
              bridge between creator and creation, science and spirituality,
              virtual and real, nothing and everything. It is designed to
              intimately connect our inner Self, our culture, our trees and the
              tree of life, the material and the digital, online world into a
              sustainable and sustaining circle of unified vibration, sound and
              light. It aims to merge us into a common flow for all beings to be
              liberated, wise, strong, courageous and connected. It is rooted in
              nonviolence, compassion, generosity, gratitude and love. It is
              blockchain (truthfulness), cloud (global, distributed, resilient),
              ai (for connecting dreams and technology), regen (nature centric)
              native. It is an inspiration, an impulse towards a quantum leap in
              consciousness, a prompt both for human and artificial intelligence
              for action towards transcending humanity into a new era, a New
              Earth, Universe and Field with the help of our most important
              evolutionary sisters and brothers, the trees.
