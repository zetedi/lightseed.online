// OFFERINGS — a being offers a BED, a SERVICE or CODE and may name the light with which they hope
// the contribution will be appreciated AFTER it is received. Trust admits; the ray follows the
// dream. The suggestion is an agreement, never a gate or purchase price. This module is the pure
// law for a sound offering draft, and — since ring 2026-09-06 — for the OFFERING OF CARE: an
// offering pointed at a being (a tree or a vision), answered on its own leaf, withdrawable until
// answered, and on acceptance co-minted as twin blocks on the offerer's tree chain and the
// receiver's own chain (the alignment shape, engagement.acceptAlignment). Circulation of light
// itself remains a coming rung: acceptance seals the agreement and moves no light.
//
// Plain contract — guaranteed now: offeringProblem refuses a draft that names no kind, no title,
// a non-positive or fractional appreciation, a malformed or overlong door, a CODE offering with
// no door (a pull request IS its link), or an offering TO a being with no tree of its own to
// stand on; offeringStatusOf reads 'open' for an offered-to offering without a status and null
// for a standalone listing (which has no lifecycle beyond its switch); only 'open' answers —
// accepted / withdrawn / declined are final; canWithdrawOffering is the author's hand alone
// while open; judgeOfferingAccept is the whole law of acceptance in the order the server applies
// it (mirrored in functions/src/offering.ts, held by tests/offering.test.ts): an existing, open,
// standing offering to a tree or vision, accepted by a hand that STANDS for the receiver (a
// tree's keeper, co-owner or steward; a vision's author), never its own author, for a receiver
// that exists and lives, from a tree that exists. Not guaranteed: who may see an offering (the
// pulse's visibility law), and any movement of light on acceptance (none, yet).
