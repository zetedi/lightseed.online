// FACE EVENTS — what a face may show whoever stands at it.
//
// The hybrid shape (ring 2026-08-19) gave every mother site a door INTO the seed; this
// module is the seed speaking BACK through that door. A visitor standing at a face —
// theohouse.org, perauset.web.app, any domain with a cradle — is AT the node, whether or
// not they ever sign in: the face's own public AND node happenings greet them. Anything
// narrower (community, circle, private) never leaves the rules' gates, because this feed
// is served by the node itself (functions/faceEvents), not by loosening firestore.rules.
//
// Plain contract — guaranteed now: isFaceFeedVisible admits exactly 'public', 'node' and
// the legacy absent-visibility (= public) forms; faceFeedOf keeps only type 'event' rows
// that pass it, shapes them to the five feed fields, and orders dated gatherings soonest
// first with dateless ones last. Not guaranteed: past-event hiding (consumers decide, as
// domain/calendar does for the seed's own room) and community-rooted events (the feed
// carries a face's DOMAIN-stamped happenings only). Enforced by tests/faceEvents.test.ts,
// which also holds the functions/src/faceEvents.ts mirror true.
