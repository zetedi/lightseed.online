// THE UNMINT (ring 2026-08-15) — taking back an accidental mint without wounding the chain.
// Only the HEAD block may be taken back: the chain is shortened by exactly its newest link,
// never severed in the middle (mid-chain deletes are refused by the rules outright). Only
// the AUTHOR's hand. ANY block kind at the head qualifies — a growth, a tree-sent reach, an
// alignment — because the severing argument binds only BELOW the head; until the tree speaks
// again, the newest word can be unsaid whole (a head reach unsaid is the message fully
// unsent, the room's copy included). Two stand forever: a guardian-witnessed watering (its
// light is already minted; rays are append-only) and decisions (their own lifecycle law).
//
// Plain contract — guaranteed: the refusals here mirror firestore.rules' unmint branch
// exactly (author, tree-chain block, head-only, unwitnessed, not a decision), and the
// service's transaction rolls the head back atomically or not at all. Not guaranteed: the
// unmade block leaves no mark — an unmint is an erasure of the newest link by the hand that
// just forged it, not a retraction; below the head, retraction remains the way.
