// FACE PREVIEW — the small, honest picture a shared door hands to whoever unfurls it.
//
// A being's own photo can weigh 2–28 MB (ring 2026-09-05, "the label follows the bytes":
// the label is honest now, the bytes stay large). Share-card crawlers cap what they will
// fetch — WhatsApp near 300 KB, most others 5–8 MB — so the /b/ card no longer points
// og:image at the stored original. It points at /face/<door>.jpg, served by
// functions/facePreview: the same photo, fitted inside FACE_PREVIEW_MAX_EDGE and
// JPEG-encoded down a ladder of (edge, quality) until it weighs under
// FACE_PREVIEW_MAX_BYTES, then kept in the bucket under a key derived from the source —
// a new photo makes a new preview, an old one is never rebuilt.
//
// Plain contract — guaranteed now: facePreviewAttempts is the encode order, largest edge
// and finest quality first, every edge within the max; facePreviewDoorOf accepts exactly
// /face/<door>.jpg (or .jpeg, or bare) for the same doors /b/ accepts; facePreviewDigestOf
// is deterministic and changes whenever the source string does (a cache key, not a
// signature); facePreviewKeyOf and facePreviewUrlOf carry that digest, so a changed photo
// is a changed key in the bucket and a changed ?v= to every crawler's cache. Not
// guaranteed: that the last attempt lands under the budget (a pathological picture may
// not — the handler serves the smallest it made), or that every platform fetches it (their
// rules are theirs). Enforced by tests/facePreview.test.ts, which holds the
// functions/src/facePreview.ts mirror true.
